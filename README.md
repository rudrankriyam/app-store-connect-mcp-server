```

### Windows
```bash
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "app-store-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@joshuarileydev/app-store-connect-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID": "YOUR_KEY_ID",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication
